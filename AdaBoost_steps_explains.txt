Boosting is basically:
  step0 Create a model 
                step1 => tarining data 
                                 step2 => Create a second model to corect the errors of privious model
                                 
  for loop the steps (1,2) untile the max number of moderls added.

__________________________________
AdaBoost:
  error = (N - num_correct)/N
  error = sum(w(i) * t_errorr(i)) / sum(w(i))
  alpha = ln((1-error)/error)                         # rate of correct compares with incorrect rate   
  w_i = w_i * exp( alpha * 1 if y!=p(y) else 0)       # to put MORE weight for training IF PREDICTED INCORRECTLY
